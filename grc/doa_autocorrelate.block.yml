documentation: |-
  "This block generates a sample correlation matrix for the input vector comprised of values drawn from the receive channels.
  Args:
    inputs: Number of inputs to the block
    snapshot_size: Determines num. of samples used to compute the sample correlation matrix
    overlap_size: Overlap size between snapshot
    avg_method: Use either standard forward-averaging method or a forward-backward averaging method to compute the sample correlation matrix."
